            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>With the world becoming more fractured and yet more connected, photos and memories from our past are at a risk to being lost, destroyed or forgotten.</p>
                <p>We still have photos stored in basements, shoe boxes and homes across the world but for how much longer? While keeping these photos is important, there is a need to store these photos digitally.</p>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
                <p>Ultimately, Kin bridges this gap.   It allows users to view and store their old photos and share them at any time.</p>
                <p>Kin keeps all of your photos in a secure location and you can organize and label the photos to your heart’s content. Kin helps people learn about their past, share memories and connect with family. </p>

                <p>I conducted 3 user tests on these initial wireframes, and while a lot of my functionality worked as intended, there were a few aspects that needed some re-work. </p>
                
             <ol type="1">
                <li>Clear up the functionality of the side bar and define what it’s functions are. </li>
                <li>Possibly remove the photo uploading page since most apps upload it automatically. It was awkward to have to click to the next screen for an action that happens without user action. </li>
                <li>Shared photo albums should be available on all albums and not only as a separate flow. </li>
            </ol>

                <h3>Now Make it Look Pretty</h3>
                    <p>One way to make Kin stand out from its competitors was to create a simple and friendly brand and visual design. I chose Kin as a product name. This app is a place for family members--whether it’s your sister or second cousin that you’ve met once--to share and store family photos. </p>
                    <p>Kin’s  personality is welcoming and is a departure from the utilitarian approach that it's competitors use. This app is primarily photo based, so the color palette is neutral yet warm. Accent colors will help portray Kin's personality. For a month in depth look at the visual style of Kin, feel free to look at the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Vt7f3aWB75_6wkRGf399UQs1c6RUTpbq" target="_blank">style guide.</a></p>
                    <p>When designing a logo, I knew that I wanted it to be simple and easily scalable. The chosen logo is abstract, but still evokes a projector or even an edge of an old photograph. </p>

                <h3>User Interface Designs</h3>
                    <p>When I began my high fidelity wireframes, I had a clear vision in my head. However, after several design iterations it became clear that it wasn’t translating and some aspects appeared clunky. I redesigned some of the elements and came up with these results. </p>

            <div id="Preference Testing">
                <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
                    <p>My design went through several iterations and while I knew what elements I preferred, I needed to see what the users liked. I did three rounds of preference testing. </p>
                <h4>Design #1 : Navigation Bar </h4>
                    <h5>Original Design: <b>39%</b></h5>
                        <img src="images/preference1.1.png">
                    <h5>Re-Design <b>61%</b></h5>
                        <img src="images/preference1.2.png">
                    <p>The re-designed navigation bar was the winner. Many felt that the plus icon was clean and simple, while others liked the icons and the fact that the options were laid out. With the plus icon, it would introduce more clicks to the process of adding photos, albums and shared albums. </p>
             <h4>Design #2 : Photo Layout </h4>
                <h5>Original Design: <b>24%</b></h5>
                    <img src="images/preference2.1.png">
                <h5>Re-Design <b>76%</b></h5>
                    <img src="images/preference2.2.png">
                <p>Showing the photos in their intended proportions instead of instagram-esque squares was more popular. People commented that they liked seeing the photos in their original proportions and that the squares were a poor use of space and reminded them too much of Instagram. </p>
            
            <h4>Design #3: Side Navigation</h4>
                <h5>Original Design <b>0%</b></h5>
                    <img src="images/preference3.1.png">
                <h5>Re-Design <b>100%</b></h5>
                    <img src="images/preference3.2.png">
                <p>The side toolbar had a 100% favorability to the re-designed. The redesign was considered to be more modern and clean and people liked the icon. People felt that the original design just felt out of date and clunky.</p>

            <div class="rectangle"></div>
            
            <div id="user testing">
            <h3>User Testing Round Two</h3>
                <p>After the preference tests, I conducted  a final round of user testing with the new elements in place. Overall, the app was easier to use and users were able to navigate it with ease. The one area with issues was the shared photo album. By isolating it into its own separate process, it was difficult for users to create shared albums. I learned that the impulse was to add users to an album during the initial album building. To alleviate this barrier, I added an “Add Family Member” to each screen of the album creation process. </p>

            <div id="conclusion">
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>It took several months to build this app from concept to prototype. I approached the project with an Agile mindset.  Here are a few lessons that I learned along the way: </p>
                
                <p>Icons. Icons help with everything--it increases accessibility (by not forcing the user to read) and elevate the design. I struggled with my designed wireframes until it was suggested that I add icons. </p>
                
                <p>I struggled the most with the visual design. I don’t come from an art background, so learning how to make the design look like what I envisioned in my head took a lot of time and re-designing. I spent hours researching UI elements, iterating my design and making everything pixel-perfect.</p>
                
                <p>Less is More. Because the prototype doesn’t have extra features or UI, it makes it very straightforward to use. Many of my respondents had never used cloud storage (or only had vague notions of it), so de-mystifying and keeping it as simple as possible were top priorities for me. </p>
